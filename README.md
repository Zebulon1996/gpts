Add the following line to your Cargo.toml file:

## Usage

### Rate Limiting
Using the FTX API requires rate-limiting requests to no more than 30 requests per second in order to avoid HTTP 429 errors. You will need to rate-limit your own requests in your usage of this library.

See the [FTX API Documentation](https://docs.ftx.com/#rate-limits)

### Pagination
If needed, you will need to paginate your own requests in your usage of this library.
See the [FTX API Documentation](https://docs.ftx.com/#pagination) and [sample Python code](https://github.com/ftexchange/ftx/blob/master/rest/client.py#L163)
